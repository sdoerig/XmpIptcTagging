XmpIptcTagging
==============

XMP IPTC tagging using exiftool. Had the problem of having over 3500 pictures scanned from analogue material. There by was an excel sheet providing information about the pictures.

To putting this information together - this is what this little bash script does. It steps through a given CSV looks for the file according to the provided picture number from the CSV and - if the file could be found - tags it.

That's it.
